Lakes

Chilika Lake
Chilka Lake, at the mouth of the Daya River, is Asia's largest brackish water lake and the second largest brackish water lake in the world. It is a bird sanctuary for millions of migratory birds, and it is also noted for its population of Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris), the only known population of Irrawaddy dolphins in India. It is one of only two lagoons in the world that are home to these species.[1]
Tampara Lake: Tampara Lake is one of the largest fresh water lakes in the state near Berhampur. The lake and the nearby Chilika Lagoon highlight the ecological diversity Odisha is blessed with.[original research?] While Tampara is a fresh water lake, Chilika is a brackish water lagoon.
Kanjia Lake: This lake inside the Nandankanan Zoological Park is known for boat riding and the scenery of Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.[citation needed]
Anshupa Lake is a horseshoe-shaped freshwater lake on the left bank of the Mahanadi River, opposite Banki in the Cuttack district of Odisha, India. Anshupa Lake in Banki is 40 kilometres (25 mi) from the city of Cuttack, which also acts as a shelter for the migratory birds in winter.
